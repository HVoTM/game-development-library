# Development road
1. Storing the pieces and board using matrices (multidimensional arrays)
2. How to solve the rotation problem in Tetris, in a really easy way, without using complex maths or anything difficult, just using an intelligent hack
    - Find more about the complex math one, as well
3. How to check collisions between the pieces and the board
4. How the main loop of a Tetris game work

# Concepts
## Reminding:
### pragma
In C++, #pragma is a preprocessor directive that allows you to give specific instructions to the compiler. These instructions are implementation-defined, meaning they can vary from compiler to compiler.
