## Features - applicability
Main features:
- Have multiple windows/ navigation
- Have Live matplotlib graphs, displaying the Bitcoin prices from various exchanges
- Allow the user to execute trades manually
- Allow the user to execute trades automatically

## Concerns
- Python:
    - resource allocation
    - Python is naturally single-threaded and very linear -> **MEGA** downside
- Relearning on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 
    - make sure to know other programming paradigms as well: declarative, functional, procedural, imperative
